# Fuzz findings

No crash, hang, or incorrect accept was identified in the bounded T25 review run (1,200 C mutations per codec, including MCU-side `ph_rx`, and deterministic Python mutation sets). Therefore there are no minimized bug reproducers or expected-failure tests.

The result is limited to host-built parser code and fixtures. It does not verify MCU hardware timing, UART behavior, interrupt concurrency, or a safety/gate PASS.
