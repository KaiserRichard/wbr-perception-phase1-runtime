# T1 completion report — 2026-10-18

**CALCULATED: ticket implementation and software verification complete.**
**UNKNOWN: physical Pi 5 + D435i qualification; no hardware gate PASS claimed.**
All changes are confined to `lab/power_usb/` and left uncommitted for the
conductor. No commit, push, installation, network access, SSH, GUI, camera,
serial-device access, or change to the shared checkout was performed.

Built `check_power_usb.py`, `thresholds.yaml`, the operator/replay README,
52 unittest cases, small historical fixtures with provenance, and saved
verification logs. Python uses the standard library only. The `.yaml` file is
JSON-form YAML 1.2 so the Pi does not need PyYAML. Thresholds have sources or
rationales; chosen bench limits are explicitly PROPOSED. Runtime duration and
interval overrides are saved into the effective config.

The collector records before/during/after throttle/temperature/PMIC observations,
binary PSU current declarations, D435i sysfs identity/speed/topology, and
before/after kernel snapshots. Optional user commands run in a bounded process
group with saved stdout/stderr and exit/termination evidence. No supplied command
means an explicitly labelled idle check. Evidence is saved verbatim, checksummed
and replayable into a new directory. Results use the COMMON.md contract and
FAIL > BLOCKED > PASS precedence, with exits 0/1/2/3 as specified.

**Reuse:** imports the existing throttle decoder and CLOCK_MONOTONIC function
from `tools/runtime_observer/resource_sampler.py`. Loads the existing
`experiments/2026-09-12-pi5-native-sensor-validation/kernel_analysis.py`
classifier into an isolated module and supplies the ticket's configurable
patterns. Existing tool files were not edited or refactored. The general
run-harness and take-tools READMEs were inspected; camera recording, trajectory
analysis and clock mapping are outside this check. No upstream tool bug was
identified that required a separate fix.

**MEASURED software verification:** host Darwin 24.6.0 x86_64, available
Python 3.11.0rc2. The target Pi's Python 3.12 was not available or executed.

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s lab/power_usb/tests -v \
  > lab/power_usb/tests/last-run.log 2>&1
```

52 tests passed; complete output is in `tests/last-run.log`. Tests cover:

- Complete synthetic PASS and the required result fields, evidence references and SHA-256 values.
- Current/newly latched under-voltage FAIL, pre-existing history handling, all eight decoded bits, missing/malformed flags and history resets.
- PMIC channel formats, low input voltage FAIL, exact boundary, and refusal to substitute core voltage for EXT5V.
- Hot firmware/sysfs temperatures and incomplete thermal evidence.
- Big-endian PSU declarations, 3 A FAIL, unavailable declarations, USB override semantics and optional 5 A policy.
- USB 2 FAIL, unrelated SuperSpeed devices, missing/re-enumerated cameras, multiple cameras and missing topology.
- Every configured kernel fault class, exclusion of baseline faults, denied/rotated/empty logs, boot changes and journal fallback.
- Missing/inconsistent capture clocks, incomplete windows and tampered/missing raw evidence.
- Load full-window success, early/failed exit, launch failure, planned termination, and a nonzero exit racing checker termination.
- Collector verbatim binary output, missing tools/timeouts, fake sysfs/procfs reads, actual bounded synthetic shell loads, and idle sampling order.
- CLI validation/output refusal, threshold justification validation, immutable replay, and the real historical partial capture.

The real fixture was assembled from authorized read-only October shared-checkout
files and September evidence already in this worktree. Each source file has a
whole-source hash and excerpt range in `tests/fixtures/real-partial/raw/provenance.json`.
The measured `throttled=0x50000` and 50.5 °C snapshot is preserved exactly;
missing observation clocks are null/UNKNOWN. Other sessions are context only,
not fabricated before/after samples. The October 14 addendum's under-voltage
observation is retained as a narrative excerpt, not invented numeric telemetry.

**MEASURED CLI verification:** invoked the actual script with `--analyze-only`
on the historical fixture, using a temporary output inside this directory.
It returned **2 / BLOCKED**, as required for missing complete-window, ADC, PSU,
USB and kernel-window evidence. Table output is saved in `tests/real-replay.log`.
The temporary replay output was removed after validating its result contract.
Both Python files compile; `--help` works. `git diff --check` reported no errors;
additional whitespace and scope checks covered new, untracked files. There are
no shell script files to run through `bash -n`.

**NOT VERIFIED / open risks:**

- No live Pi firmware commands, PMIC values, real negotiated-current property, kernel-access permissions or new-unit USB stability were tested. The 5 A property is a firmware declaration, not electrical proof. A USB-current override alone cannot pass it.
- PROPOSED voltage/temperature/sampling limits need bench-owner review before accepting production evidence. The ADC's calibration/accuracy is UNKNOWN; values are sampled, not continuous rail measurements.
- A historical under-voltage bit already set at baseline cannot distinguish another historical-only event. The result explains this limitation. Current bits, ADC readings and kernel messages remain checked.
- Other throttling/capping/soft-temperature bits are recorded but do not independently fail T1. An idle or T1 PASS does not validate timing benchmarks under throttling.
- Sequential reads perturb timing. Missing samples or large gaps block; undetected events between samples remain possible. Shell-command lifetime is a polled upper-bound estimate of activity, not proof of useful load or camera frame delivery.
- Kernel suffix extraction requires an exact retained prefix and unchanged boot ID. Rotation without a complete fallback blocks. The interval conservatively includes setup/teardown; faults there may fail a run. Unreported kernel loss and faults outside the configured pattern vocabulary remain possible.
- Board-wide kernel matching may flag another USB device; saved matches require human attribution. USB descriptors/serials are recorded and are not equated with SDK serial numbers or calibration identity.
- The load must remain in its new process group for cleanup. Abrupt checker termination (SIGKILL, power loss, disk failure) cannot guarantee a finalized result or child cleanup; normal bounded completion and handled Ctrl-C perform teardown.
- Tests passing on fixtures establish software behavior only. They do not qualify N0/N1/N3, D435i streams, thermal endurance, PSU/cable suitability, camera IMU calibration, or STM32 body-IMU/balancing safety.
