# Lab session orchestrator report

## Built

Added `run_lab_session.py` to run the power/USB, D435i raw, ROS record, ROS
replay, and saved calibration-take checks in numbered session directories. It
uses argument-vector subprocess calls, retains each check's stdout and stderr,
honors check exit codes, and verifies that a qualification result agrees with
the child exit status. `SESSION.json` and `SESSION.md` include UTC bounds, host
facts, the current repository commit, step results, and criterion evidence paths.
The plan mode prints resolved commands without creating outputs or running the
checks. Physical-action confirmations cover camera stillness, camera streaming
for record, and camera shutdown before replay.

The default dependency policy follows the ticket: power/USB gates the session,
raw qualification gates ROS, and record qualification gates replay. A saved
calibration take is independent of ROS recording and replay. `--continue-on-fail`
allows dependent steps to run after a non-PASS result.

## Verification

Ran the required unit tests:

```text
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s lab/tests_session -v
Ran 5 tests in 1.509s
OK
```

The full output is saved in [tests_session/last-run.log](tests_session/last-run.log).
Stub check executables cover a PASS chain, early FAIL stop, BLOCKED dependency
propagation, `--continue-on-fail`, and `--plan`. No Pi, camera, ROS graph, or
other hardware was accessed.

## Check review and limits

The four check READMEs and CLIs were inspected to match their arguments and
output layouts. No check implementation was changed. Their documented limits
still apply: check-tool PASS or fixture PASS is not physical gate acceptance;
the orchestrator does not start the RealSense ROS node, and calibration analysis
requires an existing take. The Pi workflow, ROS domain setup, real record/replay
interactions, prompt behavior at a physical bench, and evidence aggregation from
hardware-produced results remain **UNKNOWN / not verified**. The session commit
field is the repository `HEAD` observed when the run starts, not a dirty-tree
identity.

## Proposed commit

`Add lab session orchestrator and evidence summary`
