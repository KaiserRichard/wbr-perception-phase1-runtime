# TerrainAdvisory LED report

Implemented the USART1 advisory indication on the Nucleo-F446RE bench firmware.
The pure `bench_led_mask()` function maps the last accepted, non-stale advisory
to exactly one LED. No advisory or a stale advisory gives mask zero; the main
loop blinks RED at 2 Hz while the mask is zero. Rejected CRC and old-sequence
packets preserve the prior indication. The LEDs are display-only; the firmware
still sends no actuator output.

## Host verification

`make -C tools/link_bench test` passed. The dedicated C test checks all four
advisory values, the initial empty state, stale clearing, and preservation after
a bad CRC and an old sequence. The Python suite passed 9 tests; the QEMU test was
skipped because `qemu-system-arm` and `arm-none-eabi-gcc` are not both available
to that test's runtime environment. No board flashing or physical LED test was
performed.
